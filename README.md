## Overview
### Description
Improve your coding and interview skills by collaborating with friends using a virtual whiteboard on-the-go. Can also be used to develop your technical and problem-solving abilities. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Education / Self improvement 
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on tablets. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile versions could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Provides a list of questions for the user to choose between. The user can set a timer for each of the questions and utilize the provided whiteboard feature to solve the problem. Additionally the user can virtually collaborate on a question through the whiteboard.
- **Market:** Any individuals, primarily students, who want to improve their coding and technical interview skills.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how much time they have and how much they want to improve these abilities.
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people to collaborate on a technical question through the whiteboard, then perhaps this could evolve to include audio/video sharing as well as connecting individuals from around the world.
